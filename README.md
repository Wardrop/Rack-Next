rack-next
=========

This github project serves as the starting point for discussion and high-level planning of the next ruby web interface. Rack at this moment has no obvious future. The Rack Next project aims to get the ball rolling on a potential replacement, whether it be named Rack 2.0, or something entirely different.

Rack Next main design goal is to provide a common framework and/or specification for modern web technologies, such as WebSockets and HTTP/2. Rack Next should be as lightweight, simple and unassumining as it possibly can whilst achieving it's design objectives.
